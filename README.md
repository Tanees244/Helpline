Menu System:

The program uses a menu system with different options for sign-up, login, and access to various modules.

File Handling:

The program seems to read information from external text files (school and colleges list.txt, Hospital database.txt, Hospital list.txt) to display lists of schools and hospitals.

Console UI:

The console user interface is designed with a welcome message, options menu, and user input prompts.

Note: The code has some issues and potential improvements, such as handling edge cases, improving validation, and refining the overall structure. Additionally, the code uses some deprecated functions, like fflush(stdin). It is recommended to use platform-independent methods for clearing input buffers.
